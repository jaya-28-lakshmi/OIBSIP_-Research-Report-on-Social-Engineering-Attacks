# 🛡️ Research Report: Social Engineering Vectors

**Cybersecurity Internship – Task 5**

## 📌 Project Title

**Analysis of Phishing, Pretexting, and Baiting**

**Domain:** Cybersecurity

**Report Type:** Research & Case Study Analysis

---

## 📖 Introduction

Social engineering attacks exploit human psychology rather than technical vulnerabilities. This research report analyzes three major social engineering vectors—**Phishing**, **Pretexting**, and **Baiting**—focusing on their methodologies, real-world case studies, impacts, and preventive measures.

## 1️⃣ Phishing

Phishing is a large-scale digital attack where attackers impersonate trusted entities such as banks, companies, or executives to steal sensitive information.

### 🔍 Research Findings

* **Methodology:**

  * Email-based phishing
  * SMS phishing (Smishing)
  * Voice phishing (Vishing)

* **Psychological Techniques:**

  * Urgency (e.g., *“Your account will be closed”*)
  * Fear (e.g., *“Unauthorized login detected”*)

* **Technical Tactics:**

  * URL shortening
  * Homograph attacks (look-alike characters)
  * Logo and brand spoofing

### 📂 Case Study: FACC Whaling Attack (2016)

* **Incident:** CEO impersonation email requesting a secret fund transfer
* **Impact:** ~$54 million financial loss
* **Outcome:** CEO and CFO dismissed due to security negligence

### 🛡️ Prevention Measures

* Hardware-based **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
* Email protection using **DMARC, SPF, DKIM**
* Regular **simulated phishing training**

---

## 2️⃣ Pretexting

Pretexting involves creating a false identity or scenario to gain trust and extract sensitive information.

### 🔍 Research Findings

* Highly **targeted attacks**
* Victims researched via LinkedIn and social media
* Used to obtain **PII, internal data, or phone records**

### 📂 Case Study: HP Board Scandal (2006)

* **Incident:** Investigators impersonated board members to obtain phone records
* **Impact:** Criminal charges, congressional hearings
* **Settlement:** $14.5 million

### 🛡️ Prevention Measures

* Mandatory **call-back verification policies**
* Restrict public exposure of internal company data
* Strict identity verification before releasing PII

---

## 3️⃣ Baiting

Baiting exploits curiosity or greed by offering something appealing that contains malware.

### 🔍 Research Findings

* **Physical baiting:** Infected USB drives left in public places
* **Digital baiting:** Free software, movies, or fake system tools

### 📂 Case Study: Agent Smith Malware

* **Incident:** Malware distributed via fake game apps
* **Impact:** Over 25 million Android devices infected globally
* **Effect:** Legitimate apps replaced with malicious versions

### 🛡️ Prevention Measures

* Disable **Auto-run / Auto-play** on devices
* Deploy **EDR (Endpoint Detection & Response)** tools
* Educate employees to report found devices to security teams

---

## ✅ Conclusion

While phishing is the most common social engineering attack, **pretexting and baiting pose higher risks** due to deeper trust manipulation and physical interaction. Effective defense requires a balance of **technical security controls** and **continuous user awareness training** to recognize psychological red flags.
